# Blog Application

This is my first Rails project, a simple blog application with essential features such as a WYSIWYG editor, likes, and rating systems for posts and comments. It also includes a custom authentication system, AJAX, and JavaScript usage.

## Project Goal
The main goal of this project was to create a functional blog with key features, demonstrating how to build a dynamic web application using Rails.

## Key Features
- **WYSIWYG Editor**: A rich text editor for creating and editing blog posts.
- **Likes and Rating System**: Users can like and rate posts and comments.
- **Custom Authentication**: A user authentication system built without using any gems, relying on cookies.
- **AJAX and JavaScript**: Extensive use of JavaScript and AJAX for dynamic, real-time interactions.

## Notes
Although there is a noticeable need for refactoring in some areas of the code and architecture, this project remains a great example of an open-source blog built with Rails. It showcases the implementation of several key features that can be useful in building more complex applications.
